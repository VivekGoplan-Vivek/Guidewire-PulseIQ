The technical design and implementation for invoking connectors for Extra Large CDA pipelines are underway.\n\n#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks / Dependencies\n- **Dependencies**: The project relies on accurate identification of PPP customers using the `is_PPP` flag in Helios. Coordination with the Control Plane and downstream systems is necessary for passing the correct CDA tier values.\n- **Risks**: There is a risk of confusion or misconfiguration if the documentation and user interface do not clearly differentiate between the new enhanced tiers and existing ones. Additionally, ensuring that all necessary documentation updates are completed for internal use is critical to avoid operational issues.\n\n#### üìà Progress Summary\n- **Features**: \n  - CDP-54160: Technical design and implementation for invoking connectors for Extra Large CDA pipelines is in progress.\n  - CDP-51710: Development for supporting Extra Large pipelines for CDA self-service via Guidewire Home for PPP customers is completed.\n- **Comments and Discussions**: Ongoing discussions are addressing acceptance criteria, user journey, and documentation requirements. Updates have been made to the technical design scope and unit tests based on recent requirements.\n\n#### üìÖ Next Steps / Actions\n1. **Documentation**: Update internal documentation to include the new enhanced tiers and ensure SRE users are informed about the provisioning process.\n2. **User Interface**: Finalize the user interface changes to reflect the new CDA tiers and ensure they are only visible to eligible SRE users.\n3. **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing to verify that the provisioning process for enhanced tiers works as expected and that users can see the correct pipe size on the UI.\n4. **Coordination**: Continue coordination with the Control Plane team to ensure seamless integration and data flow for the new tiers.\n5. **Review and Feedback**: Gather feedback from stakeholders and make necessary adjustments to the implementation and documentation.",
